# Coding $S_{G}$
Project aimed at coding basic group theory in python

--Curent development--

-writing introduction 

    -> Generalize U_n so that operations take n as a parameter without breaking the Group class
    
-add basic theorems

-add subgroup test (theorem)

-creating explict permutation groups from entered set and operation (might need to put some checks that the group axioms are met)

    -> use a O(n!) algorithm to check every permutation
    
-fix readme to have better spacing 

-add asset folder and create repo art 

-merge to main branch
