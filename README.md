# Coding $S_{G}$
Project aimed at coding basic group theory in python

# Curent development

-add D_n groups 

-add EDP

-add Cayley tables

-add basic theorems

-add subgroup test (theorem)

-creating explict permutation groups from entered set and operation (might need to put some checks that the group axioms are met)

    -> use a O(n!) algorithm to check every permutation
    

-add asset folder and create repo art
