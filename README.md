# Coding $S_{G}$
Project aimed at coding basic group theory in python

--Curent development--
-writing introduction 
-Adding cyclic groups
-creating explict permutation groups from entered set and operation (might need to put some checks that the group axioms are met)
    -> use a O(n!) algorithm to check every permutation
